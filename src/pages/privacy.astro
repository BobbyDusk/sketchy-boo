      The Software does not knowingly collect any information from children

    <br />
    <h2>5. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>

      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users
      of any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>6. Open Source Commitment</h2>
    <p>
      As an AGPLv3 licensed project, our commitment to privacy is reinforced by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Transparent code that can be audited by anyone</li>
      <li>No hidden data collection mechanisms</li>
      <li>Community oversight of privacy practices</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Know what data is collected</li>
      <li>Control all your local data</li>
      <li>Remove the Software and all associated local files at any time</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h2>8. Contact Information</h2>

    <h2>9. Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy complies with global privacy laws and regulations,

      <li>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</li>
      <li>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</li>
      <li>Other applicable privacy laws</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      Since Sketchy Boo does not collect any personal information, many
      traditional privacy policy concerns do not apply. However, we maintain
      this policy for transparency and to affirm our commitment to user privacy.
