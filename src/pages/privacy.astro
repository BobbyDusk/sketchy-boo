    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>6. Open Source Commitment</h2>
    <p>
      As an AGPLv3 licensed project, our commitment to privacy is reinforced by:

      traditional privacy policy concerns do not apply. However, we maintain
      this policy for transparency and to affirm our commitment to user privacy.
