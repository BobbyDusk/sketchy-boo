      <p>
        This tool is provided for free because I help fellow developers and
        artists as much as possible. Please note that I am the sole developer
        and maintainer of this tool and that doing so takes an enormous amount
        of time, not to mention the fact that I have to pay for servers to host
        the application. Therefore, please consider donating through one of the
        following methods.
      </p>
      <br />
      <LiberapayButton />
      <p class="text-center w-8/10 italic self-center">
        If possible, please choose this method, as liberpay is an awesome
        open-source project that leaves us with the greatest amount after fees.
      </p>
